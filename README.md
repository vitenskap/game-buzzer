# Game Buzzer

This is a super simple app I made to have a virtual button on Apple devices for tabletop games. Like the ones on game shows.

You can have a liste pf pressed (or buzzed) events per round and you can reset the round on any device.

There's **NO DATA COLLECTED** there are no accounts to be made or anything. You can only set your name so it can be more easily distinguished from others with the same device. Otherwise, you could end up with multiple events from "iPhone" ðŸ˜….

You can report issues here but since I made this on my free time and the app is FREE, I'm making no gurantees for support or fixing any issues.

You can download the app [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/local-game-buzzer/id6463314943).
